## Introduction
A mobile application used to keep track the songs learned you've learned, currently learning or looking to add to your repertoire. Made using Kotlin, Room and the [DeepL API](https://www.deepl.com/docs-api/introduction/) (Refactoring in progress to implement Clean Architecture).

## Features
* Add and edit songs you have learned or trying to learn;
* Sort songs into 3 categories (not started, in progress, learned) to easily find what you're looking for;
* Add a youtube link of the song to watch it in the App;
* Get a summary of your songs and copy them to the clipboard!

## Installation & Setup
### 1. Pre-requisites
Android Studio :) and a DeepL Account
### 2. Install dependencies / Clone project
```
git clone https://github.com/amadoug2g/Song_Tracker
```
### 3. Get the DeepL API
Create a free [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/docs-api/introduction/) account to get an API key and place it anywhere (Authentication Object for me, at the root of the project)
